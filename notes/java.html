        <p>Python __init__ is similar to Java main method, it executes without calling it.</p>
        <p>Access modifies are removed from Python, which we need to mention in particualar in java.</p>
        <p>Need to specify the datatype to variable, in Python it automatically recognise based on assigned value.</p>
        <p>Need to specify return type, whether it is void, string, int or so on.<br>
            Python -  def funtion():<br>
            java - public void function(){<br><br>

            }
        </p>
        <p>Python - class newClass:<br>
            Java - public class newclass{<br><br>

            }<br>
            Python - newObject = class()<br>
            Java - class newObject = new class();
         </p>
        <p>Declaring a variable<br>
        Python - digit = 10<br>
        Java - public int digit = 10</p>

        <p>Inheritant<br>
        Python - <br>
        Java - public class drawpanel extends JPanel</p>
        
        <p>Abstract - for which we never intended to create objects. Because they're used only as superclasses in inheritance hierarchies, we refer to them as abstract superclasses.<br>
        Sub classes must declare the "missing pieces" to become "concrete" classes.<br>
        Python - <br>
        Java - keyword "abstract"</p>

        <p>Python - self<br>
        Java - this</p>

        <p>Static Method or Class methods<br>
        By declaring a method as static, we can call that method without creating any class object, i.e., className.method</p>


        <h2>Access Modifiers</h2>
        <p>By assigning a variable as private, it can be only changed by its class methods only.<br>This prevents other class methods to change its value.<br>It is main feature of <b>Encapsulation</b></p>
        <p>Constructors<br>
        Python - It is in same method as __init__
        Java - defining the method with name of class </p>
        <h2>GUI</h2>
        <p>JOptionPane class is used to for display the messages</p>
        <p>class JOptionPane is found in javax.swing.JOptionPane</p>
        <p>methods in JOptionPane are<br>
        showMessageDialog<br>
        showInputDialog</p>
        <h2>Packages</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>java.util.Random</p>
