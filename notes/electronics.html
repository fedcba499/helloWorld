    Electrical charge
    friction create imbalance of electrical ch
    protons- +, electrons - -, neutons
    coulombs (C) - 
    Neuclus - nwutrons + Protrons
    similar ch parickles - repel
    ballon and scraf
    electrician similar to plumber

    Conductkivity - how freely electrons move
    conductor - move ex - copper and gold
    insulator - resist mov of electrons 
    electrons bound tightly

    Voltage -
        diff in electrical potentential- produces force 
        to move electrons 
        9v battery - 9v diff bw two points
        Neutal and Hot line in AC current
        Ground or Common - 
        Voltage Sources
      
    Curent - Ampere
        1amp = 1 coloumnb / 1sec
        Conventions Current Notation - Mov of Holes
        positive to negative

        Short CIrcuit 
        electrons prefer easy route

    resistance  
        Opposition to flow of electrons
        ohms law = voltage = current x resistance
        V = I x R

    Energy - ability to work
        Potrntisl energy - voltage
        kinetiv energy - current
        power - watt - 1joule / sec
        power = current x voltage
        P = I x V
    
    Capacity = 1 amp for 1 hour
        AAA -   1000    10mA
        AA      2400    50mA
        C       6000    100mA
        D       1300    200mA

    voltage increse - series
    capacitance increse in parallel
